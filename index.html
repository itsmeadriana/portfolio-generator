              <p>basically i'm like triple-crossing everyone and you don't know whose side i'm on ever and to be honest, i might have my loyalties with dumbledore, but i'm mostly just loyal to my own regrets. like, i didn't get lily and instead got her killed. i didn't get the stupid dada position until i did and friggin draco malfoy got death eaters into hogwarts and we had to make a run for it bc of my unbreakable vow with narcissa. oh and also i had to kill dumbledore, the only person who ever knew any of my secrets and deepest regrets, and actually, he might have exploited that for his own means, but like. whatever works, amirite? anyway, harry will name his kid after me and i won't deserve it.</p>
